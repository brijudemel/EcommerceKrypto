# Ecommerce (React) Coding Assessment

## Current Work

- Authentication using firebase
- API integration for fetching products
- HomePage is view on authenticating
- Styling for all current pages

## To be done

- Details Page and Cart page
- Dummy payment gateway

## Improvements I would have done if I had more time

- I did not notice user section of the json DB and went with firebase login. If some time is provided I would change it to save user values in the json DB and also will work on encryption for the same.
- I will implement payment gateway and location services API for calculating delivery charges based on distance.
- I will implement wishlist for a user
- Will work on responsiveness of the site.
